Form Builder is a platform/tool for building digital services by representing them as data.

It uses [specification data](/overview/about-data#specification-data) to create [service data](/overview/about-data#service-data) that is used to generate a service that collects [user data](/overview/about-data#user-data).

It uses [JSON](/glossary#json-and-json-schema) as its data interchange format and [JSON Schema](/glossary#json-schema) to define how to create, validate and process that data.
