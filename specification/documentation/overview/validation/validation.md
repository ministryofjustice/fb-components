## Required

All form controls are required by default.


## Labels for optional fields

Fields which are set to not be required will have site-wide string (by default ‘ (optional)’) appended to their labels.


### Validation types

Form Builder’s validation is built upon [JSON Schema validation keywords](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6)


## *TODO*

A proper explanation of validation to go here.

And error strings.
